## 3.1 How was the data associated with each instance acquire?
*Was the data directly observable (e.g., raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (e.g., survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (e.g., part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.*

## 3.2 What mechanisms or procedures were used to collect the data (e.g., hardware apparatus or sensor, manual human curation, software program, software API)?
*How were these mechanisms or procedures validated?*

## 3.3 If the dataset is a sample from a larger set, what was the sampling strategy (e.g., deterministic, probabilistic with specific sampling probabilities)?

## 3.4 Who was involved in the data collection process (e.g., students, crowdworkers, contractors) and how were they compensated (e.g., how much were crowdworkers paid)?

## 3.5 Over what timeframe was the data collected?
*Doe sthis timeframe match the creation timeframe of the data associated with the instances (e.g., recent crawl of old news articles)? If not, please describe the timeframce in which the data associated with the instances was created.*

## 3.6 Were any ethical review processes conducted (e.g., by an institutional review board)?
*If so, please provide a description of these review processes, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.*

## 3.7 Does the dataset relate to people?
*If not, you may skip the remainder of the questions in this section.*

## 3.7.1 Did you collect the data from individuals in question directly, or obtain it via third parties or other sources (e.g. websites)?

*If so, please provide a description, as well as a link or other access point to the mechanism (if appropriate).*

## 3.7.5 Has an analysis of the potential impact of the dataset and its use on data subjects (e.g., a data protection impact analysis) been conducted?
*If so, please provide a description of this analysis, including the outcomes, as well as a link or other access point to any supporting documentation.*
