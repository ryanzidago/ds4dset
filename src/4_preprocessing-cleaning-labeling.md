# 4. Preprocessing/cleaning/labeling

## 4.1 Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)?
*If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remainder of the questions in this section.*

## 4.1.1 Was the "raw" data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g. to support unanticipated future uses)?
*If so, please provide a link or other access point to the "raw" data.*

## 4.1.2 Is the software used to preprocess/clean/label the instances available?
*If so, please provide a link or other access point.*

## Any other comments?
